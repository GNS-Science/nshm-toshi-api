## An intro to the nshm-toshi-api

The National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) programme has many sub-teams consuming and producing data using various software and services. 

These NSHM teams and need to share, explore and re-use these data artefacts over the programme life-cycle. Some of these artefacts may end up as publicly available assets.

Ideally a single service can provide a consistent, secure and cost-effective solution for needs. Key goals for this service are:

 - it is low-cost, for both development and operational dimensions
 - API is extensible, so new data can be readily included
 - schema controls to provide validations as required
 - ata is equally available to internal and external (to GNS) users and systems
 - easy to integrate for both automated tasks and web applications
 - authorisations provided via standard Oauth2 JWT-token services
