# Authorisation

 - [ ] it is low-cost, for both development and operational dimensions
 - [ ] API is extensible, so new data can be readily included
 - [ ] schema controls to provide validations as required
 - [ ] data is equally available to internal and external (to GNS) users and systems
 - [ ] easy to integrate for both automated tasks and web applications
 - [X] authorisations provided via standard Oauth2 JWT-token services

TODO explain how the auth architecture works

 - separate **nshm-toshi-auth** github project to make this re-useable
